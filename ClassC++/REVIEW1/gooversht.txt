CSCI 200 Exam 1 Learning Outcomes

Course Learning Outcomes
1. Design an algorithm to solve a problem by breaking the overarching problem into smaller modular
components using abstraction and object-oriented design with inheritance.
2. Translate the algorithm into a program using proper C++ syntax and fundamental programming constructs
(e.g. control structures, I/O, classes).
3. Recite & apply frequently used Linux command line commands and compile a program using a command line
build system.

Module Learning Outcomes
C++: C++ Programming
• Discuss the differences between programming languages, specifically Python & C++
A: The differences between programming languages: specifically Python and C++
• Create a Hello World program, construct a simple interactive application, and build the program via the terminal.
• List C++ primitive data types and explain the appropriate use of each data type.
• List & identify C++ arithmetic operators, translate math equations to C++, and solve arithmetic expressions.
• Discuss the effects of a statically typed language.
• Convert one data type to another.
• Recite the order of operations and evaluate an expression.
• Explain how C++ generates random numbers and write a program that generates random numbers.
• Identify C++ control structures and conclude which branch a sample program will execute.
• List C++ logic operators and evaluate Boolean expressions consisting of multiple logic operators.
• Evaluate the resultant output of a code block containing a control structure.
• Convert a program written with a for loop to a program using a while loop and vice versa.
• Identify and correct errors in program structure and logic.

CLI: Command Line Interface
• Create a Hello World program, construct a simple interactive application, and build the program via the terminal.
• List common Linux terminal commands and choose the correct commands to work with a file system via the command line.
• Describe how a computer generates a program from code.
• Write and use a Makefile.

DE: Design Elements
• Explain how C++ generates random numbers and write a program that generates random numbers.
• Identify C++ control structures and conclude which branch a sample program will execute.
• Identify C++ repetition structures and explain the following terms: looping parameter, stopping condition, and looping parameter modification.

• Identify the parts of a function.
• Explain the difference between a parameter and an argument for a function. Discuss what can be returned from a function and what a void function is.
• Explain the meaning of the DRY principle and appropriate uses for functions.
• SOLID: Discuss how functions contribute towards the Principle of Single Responsibility.
• Create functions in separate header and implementation files.
• Define and implement a procedural programming style.
• Explain the difference between a function prototype and a function implementation. Discuss the pros/cons of separate implementations.

• Define an overloaded function and recite common usages for overloaded functions.

MM: Memory Management
• List C++ primitive data types and explain the appropriate use of each data type.
• Explain how values are stored in memory, how the values are interpreted differently based on data type, and list common errors that can occur with data types.
• Diagram how integer and decimal values are represented in binary.
• Convert between binary and decimal formats.
• Explain the concept of local & global scope when functions are used within a program.
